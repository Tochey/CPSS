## A Capstone Submission system powered by a fully serverless architecture

The Computer Science Capstone Project System (CPSS) is an innovative platform designed to facilitate the exploration of previously published capstone projects. The system is powered by a reliable and efficient persistent storage solution, providing easy access to a wealth of knowledge for students, faculty, and administrators alike.

With the ability to authenticate using their Salem State email, students can browse through a vast array of past capstone projects available in the system, gaining valuable insights and inspiration for their own work. They can also submit their own deliverables, which in turn helps to improve the search feature and enrich the overall database of knowledge.

Faculty members have a comprehensive overview of their supervisees and their respective submissions, allowing them to perform various operations as needed. This streamlined approach ensures that faculty members are fully equipped to provide effective guidance and support to their students.

The administrator of the CPSS has full control over the system, with the ability to perform CRUD actions on accounts, set up a project presentation schedule, and revoke faculty access as necessary. This level of control ensures that the system is well-maintained and secure, while also enabling efficient administration and oversight.

Overall, the CPSS represents a cutting-edge approach to capstone project management, providing a wealth of resources and tools to ensure success for students, faculty, and administrators alike.
